<img src="./doc/img/app-sketch.png" alt="low fi sketch of the app">

Features:

1. ‚úÖ Add at least one of each of 3 shape types to the editor area.
2. ‚úÖ Move any of the shapes freely both vertically and horizontally.
3. üöß Activate the ‚ÄúClosest point‚Äù tool and see the highlighted points follow the mouse cursor as it moves.
4. ‚úÖ State manager integrated with drawing engine (ThreeJS)
5. ‚úÖ Serialization of state (auto-save to local storage after 10s) and reload on page refresh

## üìù Notes

Main parts:

1. [editor](./src/components/editor/index.tsx) - where everything is bundled together
2. [drawing](src/components/drawing) --- the area where shape live,
   and [drawables](src/components/engine/drawable/hooks)
   --- shapes painted in that area --- are the abstractions for the drawing logic
3. [engine](./src/components/engine) - concrete implementation with ThreeJS for `drawing` and `drawable` abstractions
   a `DrawableProto` gets converted into a final `Mesh` (see [shapes](./src/components/engine/drawable/shapes))
   and [hooks](./src/components/engine/drawable/hooks) for all the meaty logic
4. [store](./src/store/slices/drawables.tsx) - contains the state manager responsible for converting actions from within
   the drawing
   or outside the drawing (editor buttons) into changes for the drawables

General principles:

1. create UI components that are as dumb as possible (see https://www.componentdriven.org/)
2. all behavior is extracted into React hooks that can be composed together;
   hooks are closely tied to a component (by having a similar name and providing all the necessary props)
3. we used as much as possible the wrappers around ThreeJS objects provided by `react-three-fiber` and `drei`
4. we started without a state manager and added later on once the data patterns emerged

## üöß Limitations

- [ ] closest point is not working at the moment; tried different approaches but the 3d -> 2d conversions
  made the problem much harder
- [ ] TODOs are scattered throughout the codebase
- [ ] `ts-ignore` is used in more than a few places
- [ ] when dragging the shapes there is a big offset added sometimes
- [ ] `ThreeJS` is dealing mostly with 3d and using it on 2d introduces some issues:
  (camera positions, 3d -> 2d and back positioning, click handlers, distance handlers, etc.)
- [ ] `userData` attached on the mesh/scene needs to be more aligned with state manager
- [ ] performance concerns with how state manager changes are triggering unnecessary re-renders;
  the glue code provided by `react-three-fiber` is a bit of a black box

## ü§ñ Testing

We use the following test types:

1. unit (via Jest) ([sample](./src/components/engine/drawing/unit.spec.tsx))
2. integration (`react-testing-library` style)([sample](./src/components/engine/drawing/unit.spec.tsx))
3. smoke (via Storybook)
4. interaction/e2e (via Storybook)([sample](./src/components/editor-buttons/component.stories.tsx))
5. visual regression (via Chromatic)([sample](./doc/img/storybook/visual-regression.png))

```bash
npm run test-unit
```

```bash
npm run test-storybook
```

```bash
npm run chromatic
```
